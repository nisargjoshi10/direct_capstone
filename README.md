# In Silico Plasticizer Discovery
This package contains python modules for the analysis, prediction and discovery of unique, novel plasticizer molecules. We provide methods and classes for automatically generating molecular features, building a VAE, modifying its architecture and training it on a GPU. The generative framework herein is not just limited to plasticizers and can also be optimized based on any property of your choice. Installation instructions and further documentation is provided below, and tutorials can be found in the `notebooks` folder.

## Documentation
The materials design community has long been plagued by the immense number of molecules that could potentially serve a given application. For instance, the true range of drug-like molecules is estimated to fall somewhere between 10<sup>23</sup> and 10<sup>60</sup> candidates whereas only 10<sup>8</sup> have ever been successfully synthesized.
